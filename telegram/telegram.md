These cheats use different methods. 
For corsairs, I lowered the speed of the cannon balls and built a little bot around.
For Math Duel, I coded a real bot. Easy, because it's just about calculations
For Lumberjack, I just use the API, because I was to lazy to code a bot. The fastest way to get many points. Does also work with Math Duel.
